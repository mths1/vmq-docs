# Upgrade VerneMQ
Upgrading VerneMQ in a cluster requires a careful and methodical approach to ensure a smooth transition and minimize any potential disruptions. This section outlines the basic steps involved in upgrading a node in a VerneMQ cluster. Keep in mind that these steps provide only a general overview and may need to be adapted based on your specific deployment and requirements. 

It's crucial to refer to the VerneMQ documentation and resources for detailed instructions and best practices. Additionally, always perform the upgrade process first on a development or testing environment that closely matches your production setup to identify any compatibility issues before applying the upgrade in a live production environment. 

## Prepare for the upgrade
Before starting the upgrade process, it's crucial to have a proper backup of your data and configuration. This ensures you can restore your cluster to a functional state if any issues arise during the upgrade. 

Additionally, always perform the upgrade process first on a development or testing environment that closely matches your production environment. This includes using the same operating system, Erlang version, and any other relevant components. Problems can arise not only from VerneMQ itself but also from the underlying OS or Erlang version, so thoroughly testing the upgrade process in a similar environment helps identify and address any potential compatibility issues before applying the upgrade to the production environment.

**Check compatibility:**
Verify that the version of VerneMQ you want to upgrade to is compatible with your current cluster setup and any dependencies you might have. Review the release notes and documentation to understand any specific requirements or changes between versions.

**Upgrade strategy:** 
Determine your upgrade strategy based on your particular requirements and the desired outcome. Two common approaches you can take:

- Rolling upgrade: In a rolling upgrade, you upgrade one node at a time while keeping the rest of the cluster operational. This approach minimizes downtime but may require additional steps to ensure cluster consistency during the upgrade process. In VerneMQ this means letting one node leave the cluster, update the node and rejoin the cluster. Please ensure that you have properly testing this beforhand.

- Simultaneous upgrade: With a simultaneous upgrade, you take down the entire cluster and upgrade all nodes at once. This approach results in higher downtime but can simplify the upgrade process. Especially, when you do not have to keep any offline queues you can easily update all cluster nodes.

## Upgrade process (Rolling Upgrade)
**Leave the cluster and migrate clients:**
First, you need to migrate all clients away from the node you want to upgrade. Use the VerneMQ's vmq-admin cluster leave functionality, which can force migrate client queues to other nodes or await natural migration through client reconnects. This step ensures that all clients are redirected to other nodes in the cluster before proceeding. Please follow the cluster leave functionality as described here. 

**Prepare the node:**
Stop the VerneMQ service on the node you want to upgrade. Ensure that there are no active client connections to the node and that it is in a stable state before proceeding.

**Backup data and configuration:**
As an extra precaution, create a backup of the node's data and configuration files before making any changes. This step allows you to revert to a previous state if necessary. Please do not omit this step!

**Install the new version**:
Download and install the new version of VerneMQ on the node. Ensure that you use the correct package or binary for your platform, if you use the precompiled packages.

**Clean state**:
Remove any leftover data on the upgraded node, so it starts from a clean slate. This ensures that no remnants from the previous version interfere with the upgraded node's operation

**Start the upgraded node:**
Start the VerneMQ service on the upgraded node and monitor the logs for any errors or warnings. Ensure that the node successfully joins the cluster and synchronizes its state with the other nodes.

**Test and validate:**
After the upgraded node is operational, thoroughly test its functionality and perform any necessary validation to ensure that it's working as expected. Test message delivery, subscriptions, and any other features specific to your use case. Monitor the cluster for any anomalies or unexpected behavior.
